# The standard form of the mount command, is mount -t type device dir
# This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on device (which is of type  type)  at
# the directory dir.  The previous contents (if any) and owner and mode of dir become invisi‚Äê
# ble, and as long as this filesystem remains mounted, the pathname dir refers to the root of
# the filesystem on device.
